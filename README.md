# Documentation
This repository contains semi-automated markdowns I need every now and then.

One folder is dedicated to my endeavours to collect information about data science. Credit mainly goes to the open coursera courses for the content, key figures and snapshots.

The other folder contains my cv which I wanted to include fontawesome icons. 
It is semi-automated if using a combination of r-markdown files and LaTex. You would also need to download miketex containing the necessary files to get LaTex up and running. 
Apparently, there is a common error with pandoc and R that I noticed (see "[ramnathv/rcstatebin] pandoc document conversion failed with error 67")
